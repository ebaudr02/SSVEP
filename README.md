Analysis of the brain impulses from a motor imaging test

The purpose of the test is that when viewing the image shown, the test subject generates a mental
image of the part of the body that represents the image and, in doing so, generates a brain impulse, which can
be acquired and registered by the acquisition system.

We analysis the output from 14 electrodes placed on the subject's head.
